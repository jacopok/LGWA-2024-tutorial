# LGWA meeting hands-on session

[Indico event](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/2782/timetable/#20241007).

## Abstract

On Monday afternoon we will introduce the basics of gravitational wave detection and parameter estimation in the context of the LGWA science case.
We will discuss the assumptions that go into the LGWA sensitivity estimates, and how to use it within the software GWFish.
This last part will be exercise-focused, with the possibility to reproduce different figures of merit from the LGWA whitepaper based on interest from the participants. Options will include:
- horizons, both for single detectors and in a multiband context;
- detection rates for a population of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes;
- slowly-evolving binaries such as double White Dwarfs.
